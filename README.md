### Introduction
This Github page is intended as a central hub (or library) for my RimWorld art templates. 
Over the years I have made several templates for myself to ease my workflow. I wanted to help the community out by sharing them with eveyrone else.

Check out the wiki of this Github page for more information on each template and some tips on how to improve your workflow!

I intend to share more templates in the future. If you find any issues with the templates I recommend creating a new issue on this GitHub page.

### Important notes
1. You can freely use these templates, the only thing you need to do is give credit this github when you post a mod (as mentioned by the license!).
2. Make sure to copy both the .AI file and the references folder. Without the references folder you will miss textures.

### Credits
