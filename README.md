This Github page is intended as a central hub (or library) for my RimWorld art templates. 
Over the years I have made several templates for myself to ease my workflow. I wanted to help the community out by sharing them with eveyrone else.

Right now there are only two templates, but these two are very useful. The first of these is a template for atlas textures. It includes templates for pipes, power lines and walls.
The second one is for apparel. There is a simple outline template included.

Check out the wiki of this Github page for more information on each template and some tips on how to improve your workflow! (Still a work in progress)

I intend to share more templates in the future.
